Steps Involved
Loading the Dataset

Importing the dataset using appropriate libraries.
Performing an initial inspection to understand the structure and content of the data.
Handling Missing Values

Identifying missing values in the dataset.
Exploring different strategies for handling missing data, such as:
Removing rows or columns with missing values.
Imputing missing values using statistical methods (mean, median, mode) or more advanced techniques (K-Nearest Neighbors, regression).
Implementing the chosen strategy to handle missing values.
Identifying Outliers

Using statistical methods to identify outliers (e.g., Z-score, IQR).
Visualizing the data to detect outliers using plots (e.g., box plots, scatter plots).
Removing Outliers

Deciding on a threshold for outlier removal based on the chosen statistical method.
Implementing the outlier removal process while ensuring the integrity of the dataset.
Validating the Cleaned Data

Re-inspecting the cleaned dataset to ensure that outliers and missing values have been handled appropriately.
Verifying that the data is now ready for further analysis.
